Like A Boss is a CakePHP plugin that uses the Yahoo BOSS version 2 API to get web searches paginated into CakePHP.
The plugin is still under early development as the Yahoo Boss v2 is not yet released. Usage of the plugin will use CakePHP's already existing paginate methods. Requirements are PHP5, CakePHP 1.3 (not tested on 1.2 yet) and the Oauth Consumer Vendor provided by cakebaker: http://github.com/cakebaker/oauth-consumer

More info to come as the plugin develops.
